To do:   
- Add a mode where there is no epochs / rounds, but creatures gain 100 energy every time they find food, and replicate every time they get to 200 energy or above.
- Add a visual indicator in the form of green / red arrows for speed
- Make the visual indicator for sense transparent, maybe make it fill a transparent area rather than just one circle
- Represent energy by colour
- Add deacerleration and reacceleration when hitting walls to make it look more realistic
- Above could then become a factor if you ever do NEAT machcine learning

"each time a creature replicates, there is a chance that a mutation will give a creature a slightly lower or slightly higher speed"

Experiment to try:   

Let the creatures speed evolve with high sense and low sense. With high sense higher speed should prevail since they detect then steal the food quicker, whereas on low sense lower speed should prevail since the creatures rely more on luckily stumbling upon a food.

Other idea:
Food doubles in two each round or some other dependancy based on how much food there was last round.
