To do:
Code creatures to find food (and not just move randomly). Will need:
    speed
    energy: energy per timestep = speed^2
    sense: sensing distance. Once it senses food it runs straight towards it
    Food count variable

"each time a creature replicates, there is a chance that a mutation will give a creature a slightly lower or slightly higher speed"
