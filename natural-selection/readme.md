To do:   
- Fix creatures getting stuck at the side
- Add a mode where there is no epochs / rounds, but creatures gain 100 energy every time they find food, and replicate every time they get to 200 energy or above.
- Add a visual indicator in the form of green / red arrows for speed
- Make the visual indicator for sense transparent, maybe make it fill a transparent area rather than just one circle

"each time a creature replicates, there is a chance that a mutation will give a creature a slightly lower or slightly higher speed"

Experiment to try:   

Let the creatures speed evolve with high sense and low sense. With high sense higher speed should prevail since they detect then steal the food quicker, whereas on low sense lower speed should prevail since the creatures rely more on luckily stumbling upon a food.
