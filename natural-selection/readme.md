To do:
Code creatures to find food (and not just move randomly). Will need:
    speed
    energy: energy per timestep = speed^2
    sense: sensing distance. Once it senses food it runs straight towards it
    Food count variable

"each time a creature replicates, there is a chance that a mutation will give a creature a slightly lower or slightly higher speed"

Experiment to try:
Let the creatures speed evolve with high sense and low sense. With high sense higher speed should prevail since they detect then steal the food quicker, whereas on low sense lower speed should prevail since the creatures rely more on luckily stumbling upon a food.
