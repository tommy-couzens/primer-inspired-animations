To do:   
- Add a mode where there is no epochs / rounds, but creatures gain 100 energy every time they find food, and replicate every time they get to 200 energy or above.
- Idea: the above mode could be a clicker game where you click to produce food, rather than it just appearing randomly!
- Make simulation just run real time instead of having rounds
- Make creatures not eat more than 2 food
- Remove all instances of 'let' and 'var' and make it 'const' instead to make code function
- Add deacerleration and reacceleration when hitting walls to make it look more realistic
- Above could then become a factor if you ever do NEAT machcine learning
- Another factor for NEAT could be food that is varying size, then more fearsome creatures will go for that one  instead
- Add 2d graph with speed and sense both plotted
- Make game speed up when there is only 1 - 3 creatures left
- Make food get eaten slowly, going down in value
- Make food stop being eaten at 50 energy, then slowly grow back. If it reaches 200 energy it can split.

"each time a creature replicates, there is a chance that a mutation will give a creature a slightly lower or slightly higher speed"

Experiment to try:   

Let the creatures speed evolve with high sense and low sense. With high sense higher speed should prevail since they detect then steal the food quicker, whereas on low sense lower speed should prevail since the creatures rely more on luckily stumbling upon a food.

Other idea:
Food doubles in two each round or some other dependancy based on how much food there was last round.
